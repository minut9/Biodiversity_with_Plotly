# Biodiversity_with_Plotly

## Purpose
The purpose of this project  was to build a deployable dashboard (interactive webpage) that allowed users to select individual data from a belly button study of the number of subjects in the study. Select the sample ID and the webpage visually shows the specific sample IDâ€™s data deployed on multiple graphs and all the ID info.  

## Results

## Summary
By using JavaScript and HTML we can build interactive webpges that explain data results in a more visual and interactive way. This deployable webpage is a great example of how a dataset can be easier to visualize and interactive for a user.
